## Procedure

Students answered surveys anonymously online through RedCap. These surveys assess domains of student experience, as well as potential outside barriers that may inhibit successful transition to UCLA. In addition, the questions ask the participant to document their experiences or use of certain campus resources that may buffer against the relationship between being a transfer student and poor mental health outcomes. The questions also assess the participants’ mental health through a variety of questionnaires which ask about the participants’ thoughts, feelings, and experiences.

### Recruitment

Participants were recruited through one of two methods: For Psychology affiliated students, recruitment occurred through SONA systems, which is an online system used to schedule and manage the UCLA Psychology Department human subject pool. In addition, to obtain data from the wider (non-Psychology) community at UCLA, we also had a non-SONA based version of the questionnaire (using RedCap). The survey was open for the Spring 2020 term, and all survey respondents during those quarters were included in the final analyses.
